Hi!

I'm Lucas, I'm a rising Sophomore at Tufts University studying Computer Science and International Relations. I'm half-German, half-American, but was born and raised in Belgium and educated in a British international school - my intrigue with the concept of identity and how people of different identities interact with one another almost definitely stems from my background. My interest in Computer Science comes from playing around with the Lego Mindstorms NXT's programming software (I was fortunate enough to be introduced to this through school), and I still distinctly remember the awe I felt when I discovered a lego robot could solve a rubix cube, become a pinball machine, and even a Braille printer. In my spare time, I enjoy playing piano and staying fit by either going to the gym, playing soccer (football), basketball, or swimming.
